\section{Dissertation Organization}
This remainder of this dissertation is organized as follows: \\
chapter two discusses the modeling used to describe entry trajectories\\
chapter three describes the entry guidance problem, especially target condition(s)\\
chapter four outlines the guidance strategy, including posing the problem as a ROCP. Gain optimization as well. \\
chapter five gives an algorithm based on constrained DDP/SLQ to solve the ROCP \\
chapter six presents the assessment conditions (simulation details, Monte Carlo) \\
chapter seven presents an assessment of the guidance algorithm. Also demonstration of open-loop vs closed loop necessity of UT, choice of alpha parameters. Problems with joint optimization as well (UT cov almost zero but MC cov bad) \\
chapter eight concludes the dissertation \\

Questions: 
Where to describe the issue with joint optimization of reference/gains?
