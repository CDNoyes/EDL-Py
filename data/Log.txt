A version controlled log of data sets. Perhaps an excel document or something formatted would be cleaner.


2/3/17  - MC_Apollo_1000_K6_velocity - Standard Apollo with overcontrol set to 6
2/5/17  - MC_Apollo_1000_K1_velocity - Standard Apollo with overcontrol set to 1
2/6/17  - MC_Apollo_1000_K1_energy - Energy variant of Apollo with overcontrol set to 1
2/11/17 - MC_Apollo_1000_K1_energy_drag_rate - Uses drag rate in feedback in place of altitude rate
2/11/17 - MC_Apollo_1000_K1_energy_no_rate - Uses neither altitude rate nor drag rate in feedback, only the drag portion
2/11/17 - MC_Apollo_1000_K1_energy_no_drag - Uses exclusively altitude rate (and range to go) in feedback, neglecting the drag portion
2/11/17 - MC_Apollo_1000_K1_energy_no_drag_dr - Uses exclusively drag rate (and range to go) in feedback, neglecting the drag portion

2/24/17 - Box_3sig_Apollo_K1_energy - The 16 vertices of the 4-uncertain parameters evaluted at their 3-sigma values
