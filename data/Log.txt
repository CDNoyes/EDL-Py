A version controlled log of data sets. Perhaps an excel document or something formatted would be cleaner.


2/3/17  - MC_Apollo_1000_K6_velocity - Standard Apollo with overcontrol set to 6
2/5/17  - MC_Apollo_1000_K1_velocity - Standard Apollo with overcontrol set to 1
2/6/17  - MC_Apollo_1000_K1_energy - Energy variant of Apollo with overcontrol set to 1
2/11/17 - MC_Apollo_1000_K1_energy_drag_rate - Uses drag rate in feedback in place of altitude rate
2/11/17 - MC_Apollo_1000_K1_energy_no_rate - Uses neither altitude rate nor drag rate in feedback, only the drag portion
2/11/17 - MC_Apollo_1000_K1_energy_no_drag - Uses exclusively altitude rate (and range to go) in feedback, neglecting the drag portion
2/11/17 - MC_Apollo_1000_K1_energy_no_drag_dr - Uses exclusively drag rate (and range to go) in feedback, neglecting the drag portion

2/24/17 - Box_3sig_Apollo_K1_energy - The 16 vertices of the 4-uncertain parameters evaluted at their 3-sigma values

3/30/17 - Apollo_CTRB_50_1km - Controllable set estimation for a fixed reference trajectory. Reference bank: HEPBankSmooth(d['time'],*[99.67614316,  117.36691891,  146.49573609], minBank=np.radians(30))
                               Maximum downrange to be considered in the set is 1 km, and 50 pts were used to estimate the boundary. Only variations in EFPA and V0 are considered.
        - Apollo_CTRB_100_1km - More points
        - Apollo_CTRB_150_500m - More points, and a small tolerance
        - Apollo_CTRB_100_500m_aero - Estimates variations in Cl and Cd from which the target downrange is still achieved.

3/31/17 - Apollo_CTRB_100_500m_NR - Removes bank reversal maneuvers entirely
        
8/4/17	- MC_OpenLoop_2000 - Open loop trajectories with BC~380 and only the four parametric uncertainties 
	- NC_NMPC_2000 - CTNPC, basically Joel's implementation without range to go term and using open loop lateral logic
